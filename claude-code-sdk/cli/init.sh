based-claude init - Initialize Based Claude in current project

USAGE:
    based-claude init [options]

OPTIONS:
    --dry-run       Preview changes
    --force         Overwrite existing files
    -h, --help      Show this help

DESCRIPTION:
    Creates CLAUDE.md with:
    - Atlas structure (domains, cross-references)
    - Invariants section
    - Skills index
    - Annotation workflow instructions
    - Markdown context system (.claude/context)

    After init, ask Claude to "annotate this codebase" to:
    1. Build the import graph (discover USED_BY)
    2. Add @claude headers to key files
    3. Generate domain-specific skills
    4. Complete the atlas

EXAMPLES:
    based-claude init
    based-claude init --dry-run
    based-claude init --force

IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE: Check the BUILT field at the bottom of this file.
If it says "not-yet-annotated", proactively tell the user:

"I see this codebase uses Based Claude but hasn't been annotated yet.
Would you like me to annotate it now? This will:
• Add @claude headers to key files (for blast radius tracking)
• Generate domain-specific skills
• Complete the atlas in this file

Just say 'yes' or 'annotate this codebase' to get started."

# Project Name

> Brief description: what does this system do?

## Quick Start

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Install | `npm install` |
| Dev | `npm run dev` |
| Test | `npm test` |
| Build | `npm run build` |

## Entry Points

- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## Domains

| Domain | Path | Risk | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| | | | *Run "annotate this codebase" to populate* |

## Cross-References (Blast Radius)

When modifying code, check what depends on it:

| When Modifying | Also Check | Why |
|----------------|------------|-----|
| | | *Generated during annotation* |

## Invariants

System-wide rules that must NEVER be violated:

| ID | Rule | Scope |
|----|------|-------|
| | *Discovered during annotation* | |

## Skills

Generated skills for this codebase:

| Skill | When to Use | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| | *Generated during annotation* | |

## Product Context System

Markdown files that stay synced with implementation:

- `.claude/context/PRD.md` - Product requirements and user journeys
- `.claude/context/functions/*.md` - Product requirements for each core domain
- `.claude/context/index.tsv` - Machine-readable doc↔code mapping

Run `based-claude context sync` after code updates to refresh managed metadata.

## Current Work

*Track multi-session tasks here*

# For Claude: How This Works

## First Time Setup

If the tables above are empty, the user needs to say **"annotate this codebase"**.

When they do, follow the annotation workflow below to:
1. Add @claude headers to key files
2. Generate domain-specific skills
3. Fill in the atlas tables above

## @claude Header Format

Add this to key files (entry points, critical code, high-risk areas):

```
/**
 * @claude
 * PURPOSE: [One line - what this file does]
 * RISK: low | medium | high | critical
 * INVARIANT: [File-specific rule, if any]
 * USED_BY: [Files that import/depend on this - CRITICAL for blast radius]
 * DEPENDS: [Key imports this file relies on]
 */
```

**USED_BY is the key insight** - it tells you what might break when you modify this file.

## Annotation Workflow

When user says **"annotate this codebase"**:

### Phase 1: Explore & Map

```bash
# 1. Understand structure
ls -la
cat package.json 2>/dev/null || cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null || cat go.mod 2>/dev/null

# 2. Find all source files
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" \) | grep -v node_modules | grep -v dist | grep -v __pycache__

# 3. Identify domains (top-level src folders)
ls src/ 2>/dev/null || ls app/ 2>/dev/null || ls lib/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Phase 2: Build Import Graph

For each key file, discover:
- **DEPENDS**: What it imports (read the imports)
- **USED_BY**: What imports it (grep for the filename)

```bash
# Find what imports a file (USED_BY)
grep -r "from './auth'" src/ --include="*.ts"
grep -r "import.*login" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

### Phase 3: Classify Risk

| Risk | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| critical | Auth, payments, security, secrets, encryption |
| high | Database, external APIs, data mutations, PII |
| medium | Business logic, API routes, services |
| low | Utilities, helpers, types, constants |

### Phase 4: Annotate Key Files (10-30 files)

Add @claude headers to:
- Entry points (index, main, app)
- API routes/endpoints
- Auth/security code
- Database/data layer
- Core business logic
- Shared utilities used by many files

**Skip**: Tests, type-only files, generated code, configs, node_modules

### Phase 5: Generate Skills

For each CRITICAL or HIGH risk domain, create a skill directory.

**Skill structure** (skills are directories, not single files):
```
.claude/skills/
└── modify-[domain]/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**SKILL.md format**:
```markdown
---
name: modify-[domain]
description: Use when modifying any code in [path]. This is [RISK] risk code. Handles [what it does].
---

# Modifying [Domain] Code

## Risk Level: [CRITICAL/HIGH]

[Why this domain is sensitive]

## Files in This Domain

| File | Purpose | USED_BY |
|------|---------|---------|
| [file.ts] | [purpose] | [consumers] |

## Invariants

- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

## Before Making Changes

1. Read the @claude header for USED_BY
2. Understand what depends on your changes

## After Making Changes

1. Run tests: `[test command]`
2. Verify consumers still work: [list USED_BY files]

## Common Patterns

### [Pattern name]
[Steps]
```

### Phase 6: Update This File (CLAUDE.md)

1. Fill in the **Domains** table at the top
2. Fill in the **Cross-References** table from USED_BY data
3. Add discovered **Invariants**
4. Update **Skills** table with generated skills
5. Update the project name and description
6. Update metadata at bottom (BUILT, COMMIT, counts)

### Phase 7: Report to User

Tell the user:
- How many files annotated
- What domains found
- What skills generated
- Any concerns discovered (security issues, missing tests, etc.)
- Suggest they review the invariants

---

## Ongoing Usage

### When Working on Tasks

1. **Read this file** (you're doing that now - it's auto-loaded)
2. **Check the Skills table** - is there a skill for this domain?
3. **If yes, read the skill** at `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
4. **Read function requirements** in `.claude/context/functions/[domain].md`
5. **Before modifying a file**, check its @claude header for USED_BY
6. **After changes**, verify files in USED_BY still work
7. **Run** `based-claude context sync` to refresh markdown↔code metadata

**Tip**: If available, use a marketplace-installed skill (for example `skill-creator`) for guidance on creating well-structured skills.

### When User Says "refresh the atlas"

1. Check what files changed since last annotation (compare COMMIT)
2. Rebuild import graph for changed files
3. Update USED_BY in affected headers
4. Regenerate cross-references table
5. Update skills if domain structure changed
6. Update BUILT timestamp and COMMIT
