# Doc Coverage Checklist

Use this checklist when generating or reviewing product documentation.

## Product Surface

- CLI commands and flags are documented (if applicable).
- API endpoints, parameters, and responses are documented (if applicable).

## Accuracy

- Names, commands, and options match the current implementation.
- Default values match the current implementation.
- Behavioral descriptions reflect actual code paths.
- Version requirements and dependencies are current.

## Usability

- Documentation is organized by user task, not code structure.
- A getting-started guide exists for new users.
- Common workflows have step-by-step instructions.
- Code examples are working and derived from the actual codebase.

## Completeness

- Every user-facing feature has corresponding documentation.
- Edge cases and limitations are noted where relevant.
- Error messages and troubleshooting steps are included for common issues.
