# Brand Design

This skill translates Salient's complete visual identity and brand rules into concrete design and copy decisions for slides, web pages, one-pagers, sales collateral, emails, and other artifacts. Prioritize precision and consistency over novelty.

Read `references/salient-brand-guidelines.md` before generating or revising deliverables.

## Workflow

1. Identify output type and medium (slide deck, web section, landing page, doc, ad, email, etc.).
2. Read the brand reference and map rules into a delivery checklist for that medium.
3. Generate or revise content/design with strict adherence to the visual system (color, typography, components, layout) and voice constraints.
4. Run a final brand QA pass and explicitly list any intentional deviations.

## Visual Design System

The Salient visual identity communicates **premium, warm, trustworthy** — never cold, generic, or startup-trendy.

### Color Application
- Use the **cream-dominant palette**: ~80% Main Cream, ~15% Secondary Cream, ~5% Charcoal for high-impact moments.
- Gold (`#C9A962`) is the sole accent color — use it for CTAs, highlights, numbered elements, and borders.
- Default text: Charcoal `#0F0F0F` on cream backgrounds; white `#FFFFFF` on charcoal backgrounds.
- Metrics use green/red indicators (`#34C759`/`#FF3B30`) with `+`/`−` prefixes.

### Typography Pairing
- **Halant** (serif) for all display headlines — tall, tight, line-height 0.9–0.95. Never for body text.
- **Geist** (sans-serif) for all body copy, labels, data, and UI — 14–16px default, 12px minimum.
- Create strong hierarchy through extreme size contrast between Halant headlines and Geist body.

### Component Patterns
- **Buttons**: Pill shape (100px radius), Gold fill for primary CTAs, charcoal for secondary.
- **Badges**: Feature/category badge on every slide — acts as breadcrumb navigation.
- **Icons**: Bold filled style, white on charcoal surfaces (`#1A1A1A`).
- **Cards/containers**: 24px corner radius, consistent across all rounded elements.

### Visual Language
- Warm radial glows as background accents on cream slides (subtle, not overpowering).
- Floating decorative elements: particle dots, circles, abstract shapes at reduced opacity.
- Gold-to-transparent gradients for accent bars, dividers, and highlight areas.
- Rounded geometric forms throughout.
- **Dark mode only**: Glassmorphism/blur effects exclusively on charcoal backgrounds — never on cream.

### Layout Constraints
- 5% safe zone on all edges — nothing touches boundaries.
- 70/30 feature split: visual content to benefit text.
- Negative space = premium. When something feels busy, add more padding.

## Copy and Messaging Rules

When writing or editing copy:

- Lead with concrete outcomes and compliance credibility.
- Use specific terms (for example: TCPA, FCRA, FDCPA, GLBA, UDAAP, PCI Level 1, SOC 2, audit trail).
- Keep language customer-centered and operationally grounded.
- Remove hype words, vague claims, and unspecific compliance statements.
- **On-brand tone**: Specific, grounded in the customer's reality, leads with benefit.
- **Off-brand tone**: Vague, hype-driven, company-centered, overpromising.

## Required QA Before Finalizing

Validate every output against these checks:

1. **Typography**: Halant only for display/headlines; Geist/system for body and UI. No substitutions.
2. **Color**: Palette usage follows distribution (~80/15/5 cream/secondary/charcoal), gold accents only.
3. **Text color**: Charcoal on cream, white on charcoal — verify all text is readable.
4. **Voice**: Claims are specific, compliant, and non-hype.
5. **Layout**: 5% safe zones, 24px corner radii, purposeful hierarchy, generous negative space.
6. **Components**: Badges present, CTAs are gold pills, icons are bold-filled, metrics use correct indicators.
7. **Dark mode**: Glass/blur effects only on charcoal — never on cream.
8. **Overall impression**: Premium, warm, trustworthy — not cold, not generic-startup.

If any rule is violated, fix it before delivering.
